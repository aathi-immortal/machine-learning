# machine-learning

To run the code you provided, you will need to install the following Python packages if you haven't already:

1. **pandas**: It's used for data manipulation and working with DataFrames.
   You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install pandas
   ```

2. **xgboost**: It's used for training the XGBoost classifier.
   You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install xgboost
   ```

3. **scikit-learn**: Although you didn't explicitly import it in your code, scikit-learn is often used in conjunction with XGBoost for tasks like splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and for metrics like accuracy.
   You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```

After installing these packages, you should be able to run the code successfully. Make sure you have Python installed on your system as well.
